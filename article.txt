The Chicago rat hole is a hole shaped like a rat in the sidewalk of West Roscoe Street in the Roscoe Village neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, United States. After existing for decades, it became a viral phenomenon on social media (mainly Twitter) in January 2024, attracting tourists to the site.

An apparent example of accidental lifecasting, the hole was described by The New York Times as "Chicago's Stonehenge", as its origins are unknown.

The hole gained worldwide attention on January 6, 2024, via a tweet by Chicago-based comedian and writer Winslow Dumaine. The post quickly became viral, compelling many Chicago residents to visit the hole—in what has been described as a "pilgrimage"—and to make offerings to it, such as coins, flowers, candles, cheese, cigarettes, alcohol, children's toys, foodstuffs, and estradiol pills. One group of visitors took shots of Chicago specialty Malört beside the hole, before leaving the bottle as an oblation. The Riot Fest Historical Society also dedicated a plaque at the site of the hole.

Despite its newfound attention in 2024, the hole had existed for at least 20 to 30 years, according to locals. A local softball team has been using the rat as its unofficial mascot since around 2018.
